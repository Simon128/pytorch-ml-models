# pytorch-ml-models
This repository offers a variety of PyTorch implementations of machine learning models for computer vision.
It uses mmcv for ops. However, it is not supposed to replace other open-mmlab repositories such as MMRotate. The intention
behind this repository is to offer minimal implementations of models without training pipelines etc., to be used 
and modified for own research purposes. We realized, that adapting repositories like MMRotate to ones own needs during 
research, can be quite inconvenient for rapid prototyping of new research ideas, due to the monolithic nature of such repositories. 
We therefore offer simple (and feature poor) implementations of models in this repository to be copy, pasted and modified for 
ones heavily customized research pipelines.
